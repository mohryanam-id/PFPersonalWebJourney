## Plan

### Purpose and Goals

My personal website serves as a platform to showcase my skills, portfolio, blog, and contact information. Its primary objective is to provide visitors with a comprehensive understanding of who I am, what I do, and how to get in touch with me. By creating this website, I aim to establish an online presence that highlights my expertise, shares my work, and engages with my target audience.

### Target Audience and Needs

I have identified my target audience as professionals, potential clients, and collaborators within my industry. They are individuals who are interested in my skills, services, and work experience. To cater to their needs, my website will provide them with valuable content, insights, and a seamless browsing experience. I want to ensure that visitors can easily find the information they seek, learn about my capabilities, and ultimately connect with me for potential collaborations or opportunities.

### Website Structure and Navigation

To create a user-friendly experience, I have planned the structure and navigation of my website thoughtfully. Here's an overview of the sections and pages I will include:

- Home

  An engaging introduction that captures visitors' attention and provides a glimpse into what they can expect from my website.
  Highlights of my key skills, qualifications, and areas of expertise.
  A call-to-action button encouraging visitors to explore further or contact me.

- About Me

  detailed overview of my professional background, education, and work experience.
  Insight into my passion, values, and what drives me in my career.

  - Each experience entry includes:

    - Company/Organization name
    - Position title

- Contact

  Clear and accessible contact information, including email, phone number, and social media profiles.
